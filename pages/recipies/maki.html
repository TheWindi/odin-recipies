    <h2>Avocado Maki - easy to make at home</h2>
    <p>Avocado Maki are one of those foods you could eat everyday (at leas I could). You can get them literally everywhere and usually not regret it.</p>
    <p>But Maki are not the most affordable food to enjoy on a daily basis. Thats why you should just make them yourself and save a pretty penny doing so!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sushi Rice</li>
        <li>Seaweed Sheets</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Lemon (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you can, use a sushi rolling mat. If you don't have one you can use a dish towel.</p>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You can cover the sushi mat with plastic wrap for easier cleanup.</li>
        <li>Add the nori sheet to the bamboo mat, shiny side down. Grab a handful of rice and spread it on ¾ of the nori sheet, leaving about ½ inch of the upper portion of the nori uncovered. When spreading the rice, dip your fingers into some water to help keep the rice from sticking.</li>
        <li>Layer 3-4 pieces of sliced avocado to the center of the rice spread, from one side to the other.</li>
        <li>With clean hands, grab the top of the mat and roll it over to close the filling.</li>
        <li>Use your bamboo mat and squeeze it across to shape the roll tightly into a circular shape. Pull the bamboo mat over and continue shaping the roll until you complete it. </li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to swiftly cut the roll into 1 inch thick rolls.</li>
        <li>If you don't eat them right away, you can sprinkle some lemon over your creation. This will keep the Avocado from turing brown. (Also lemon goes great with everything.)</li>
    </ol>
