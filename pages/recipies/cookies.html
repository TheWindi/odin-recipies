        <p>Are you sitting at home on a rainy sunday afternoon and have a sudden craving for sweets? Were you invited to a party and want to bring something home-made that doesn't require you to spend all morning in the kitchen?</p>
        <p>Well, this is the recipe for you! Not only are these cookies fast and easy to make, they are also vegan. And of course they taste like heaven.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For 10 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>100g sugar</li>
            <li>165g brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of slat</li>
            <li>120g coconut oil (melted)</li>
            <li>60ml plant-based milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>185g flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>230g chocolate (chunks) - mix dark and light chocolate if you want</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, salt, and coconut oil until combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk in non-dairy milk and vanilla, until all sugar has dissolved and the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly.</li>
            <li>Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Be sure to leave at least 2 inches of space between cookies and the edges of the pan so cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until cookies just begin to brown.</li>
            <li>Let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
