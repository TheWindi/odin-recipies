        <h1>This is my fist project for The Odin Project</h1>
        <p>This website it built by applying what I learned it the <em>Foundations</em> course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, a free online recource to learn basic web development.</p>
        <p>I hope to polish this website over the following lessons with some more style using CSS and eventually making it more interactive with JavaScript.</p>
